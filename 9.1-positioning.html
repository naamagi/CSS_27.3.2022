<!-- An element with Absolute position is positioned relative to its parent element that is positioned "relative".
Since the outer element is not relative, the inner element will use the body as outer element. 
Therefore the inner element is 10px below the body's top.
In order to have the element in the required place, I added position: relative; to the outer element.-->
